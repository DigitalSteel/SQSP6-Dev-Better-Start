SQS6-Dev-Better-Start

This is a demo project to get a better working template start for the SquareSpace 6 developer platform using Twitter Bootstrap.

This project is not intented to be a custom template. Very little design will be applied.

The goal of the project is to give the user a choice of navigation and style (through template.conf) to match any of the current Bootstrap examples.
